Braille Instant Messaging Application

This code is meant to combine with hardware I created to convert the signals into stored information. The goal of this project is to create
a cheaper solution compared to current text-to-braille solutions. 

When you see reference to a "cell", it references a 2x3 grid of dots that can be raised or lowered, to create a tactile interface. The
cells use linear actuators to create a resettable array that can be used over and over.

The code and hardware is open source so anyone can use these solutions!
